But also knowing that robots can still make mistakes in task so sometimes with the hard level I was going down to less trust. Medium I was mostly trusting.","I was thinking that it was more like does our actions impact what the robot is doing. Because of the speed of the robot arm and how the calibration works.

I thought it would be more in sync with me, so that was strange with me. I was thinking am I doing something wrong, is it following me or its own sound.
