I felt like it changed slightly throughout the experiment. I made sure even when it was changing to match it,more so the robot but i was doing all of that too drop the ball in,I just threw percentages at it based on nothing just  tended to do 80 for medium and 60 for hard and 100 for easy and switched it up if i did too many in a row. Overall i gave it pretty good chance of completing the tasks well,"If i had to guess, it would be the robots ability to perform based on or depending on the statistic of what the operator expected it to do, and general feelings about robotic arms, if you are working along side a robot arm how would you feel doing that",No

I thought it would be more in sync with me, so that was strange with me. I was thinking am I doing something wrong, is it following me or its own sound. So it made me wonder if I was doing something wrong and it was moving the balls differently in how it would grab the balls. I grabbed the balls the same for each one. ","it was fun.

I expected it to be the same as me but it was interesting because it made it more human in a way that it was not doing the same way consistently. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. In one way its nice that it is more human like by moving differently but I also had an expectation that it would in the same way at the same time for each ball. ",both. I was trying hard to look at the robot but it is hard when putting my hand down to make sure it is the right ball. I tried to look more at the robot while I was doing it which is why the speed change didnt help that much. Because it was off on the speed that stopped me from following the robot.,"It was kindof arbitrary. At the beginning I was thinking it did well with easy obstacles and I assumed that it would do well with easy obstacles. Once I got one wrong, I thought maybe I shouldn't be that confident. Because I didn't see it do medium and hard obstacles, I didn't know but assumed it would do worse, similar to humans but I was really confident in the easy task. I had a lot of trust in thr robot overall. Didn't choose zero for any of them.",I think it was related to my experiences and trust with the robot and how I think it will do compared to how the robot performs overall. Everything was related more to my own thoughts and intuition. I thought at first it would be more about how well the robot would perform but now I think it is more about my experiences with it.,No other thoughts
