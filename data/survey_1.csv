Description of the research 

You are invited to participate in a research study about interacting with robots. You have been asked to participate because you are a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The purpose of the research is to understand human robot interactions. This study will include University of Wisconsin-Madison students. This research will be conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Psychology building.



What will my participation involve?

If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to do interactive tasks with a robot and fill out surveys. Your participation will last approximately 20 minutes for the completion of this at-home survey and 1 hour and 30 minutes for the in-person study for a total of 1-hour and 50 minutes for the entire study.



Recording information 

Video tapes, audio tapes, and photographs will be made of your participation at the in-person portion of the study. These recordings will be used only by approved personnel on the research team. These recordings may be viewed by the public in visual or digital reports of the research or in future research studies only after your identity is masked and de-identified by blurring your facial features and removing any identifying sound from the recordings. The tapes/recordings will be kept indefinitely.



Should you choose to withdraw your de-identified video/audio data from being kept in our public records, you may contact the research team via the email and phone numbers provided above to request its removal. Upon receipt of such email, we will remove your video/audio data from any open repositories. Participants will have 1 year after completion of the study to request this removal.



Are there any risks to me?

We don't anticipate any risks to you from participation in this study. You will interact with a robotic arm called a Kinova. These robotic arms pose very minimal risk as they were designed and tested to be safely used with humans. Additionally, you will not touch the robotic arm or be within a distance where the robotic arm would go into your line of movement. There is always a risk of a confidentiality breach.



Are there any benefits to me?

We don't expect any direct benefits to you from participation in this study, however you will get to interact with a robot.



How will my confidentiality be protected?

This study is confidential. Neither your name or any other identifiable information will be published. Only approved personnel on the research team will have access to the data. The research team will not collect names or other written identifying characteristics from participants. All video, audio, and photo data will be securely stored and password protected in a digital format.



Any video/audio/photos will be de-identified before being presented in any public databases or reports about the research. Identifiers will be removed from the identifiable private information (video/audio/photos) and after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the participant or the legally authorized representative. Survey data may also be shared in it’s raw form as no identifiable information will be acquired from surveys.



If you participate in this study, we would like to be able to quote you directly without using your name. If you agree to allow us to quote you in publications, please check the statement at the bottom of this form.



Whom should I contact if I have questions?

You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think that participating in the research has hurt you, talk to the research team or contact the Principal Investigators Paula Niedenthal and Bilge Mutlu at (608) 890-4379.



If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant or have complaints about the research study or study team, call the confidential research compliance line at 1-833-652-2506. Staff will work with you to address concerns about research participation and assist in resolving problems.



If you decide not to participate or to withdraw from the study, you may do so without penalty.
